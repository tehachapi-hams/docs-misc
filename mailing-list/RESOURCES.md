# Resources for folks new to mailing lists

## About

Not all ham radio operators are familiar with the general function or usage of electronic discussion groups (mailing lists). Here are some resources to help (which could certainlyl be more flushed out).

- You can learn how to control how messages are sent to you via email, [at this link](https://groups.io/helpcenter/membersmanual/1/controlling-your-email-subscription-preferences/email-delivery).
