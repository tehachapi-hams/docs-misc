# About / Charter

The below section generally contains the information that should remain in the "About" page for the mailing list. This should be considered the upstream source of truth, for whatever platform we ultimately land on.

Either a rendered or unrendered version of this Markdown document, should hopefully be pasteable into whatever data entry point we have available, starting below this horizontal line:

***

A general place for local ham radio operators to coordinate ad-hoc events, contacts or gear exchange.

While generally aligned with the Tehachapi area, this list is not meant to exclude our friends and neighbors in nearby communities who we enjoy collaborating with from afar and when they are visiting town.

New users are welcome, if you don't know any of the local hams, please email [tehachapi-hams+owner@groups.io](mailto:tehachapi-hams+owner@groups.io) to introduce yourself after requesting to join so we know you're not a robot :)

**General discussion for topics like, but not limited to:**

- *"I'm downtown at the park and am playing with SSTV if anyone wants to tune in or join."*
- *"I'm trying XYZ mode on ABC MHz, anyone around to see if you can hear me?"*
- *"Does anyone have a 10k resistor?"*
- *"I just got a shipment of 2,000 10k resistors, anyone want any? I only needed 3."*
- *"Selling my XYZ for $200, who wants it?"*
- *"I need someone to hold a line while I'm on the tower."*
- *"I'm mad at the radio, anyone want to go bowling?"*

**If you're not used to email discussion lists, it's recommended you learn how to:**

- Filter and thread your email before joining.
  - Resource: [How to create filters in GMail](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en)
  - Resource: [Set your mailing list delivery preferences in groups.io](https://groups.io/helpcenter/membersmanual/1/controlling-your-email-subscription-preferences/email-delivery).
  - (Additional resource links are welcome!)
- Know how to mute notifications to suit your own hours of availability in your email client.
- Remember that responding to someone on-list, goes to everyone on the list, but they may not read or see it.
- We cannot be responsible for your own email settings (but someone may offer to help you with them!)

**Discussion is generally wide.**

- Banter is welcome.
- Messages don't need to be strictly ham radio related, probably anything involving electronic communications is welcome, including but not exclusive to:
  - Supporting infrastructure (either physical or electronic)
  - Unlicensed spectrum usage (WiFi, LoRA, etc...)

**The only real rules are:**

- Remember that people are probably responding to be helpful, not hurt your feelings.
- Be excellent to each other.

This mailing list is run on the free tier of groups.io:

- They offer no service guarantees.
- We offer no service nor availability guarantees.
- We are living on their good graces, the good graces of the members, and will try to persist in one form or another if that doesn't work out.
- It is **not recommended** to use this for emergency communications (doesn't mean it's not worth a try if you have no other options though!)
- Nobody can be responsible for other people's posts to this mailing list.
  - Wildly inappropriate posts will probably be removed from the archive, but we cannot remove them from your email inbox.
- The free tier of groups.io has limited storage, archives are subject to deletion at any time due to this.
  - If you want to keep information, you'll need to rely on your own email backups.

**Why not just use the the local repeaters for this?**

- Many folks in the area operate at different times of the day (there are many second & third shift jobs in the area), and reaching everyone at the same time is not probable.
- Many local operators are not in line of sight of the repeaters (especially folks to the east or south of Tehachapi).
- People are encouraged to use the local repeaters for discussion as they see fit, they will work better for live coordination than a mailing list.

While this mailing list **is not operated or managed** by the local Tehachapi Ham Radio Club ([TARA - AC6EE](https://ac6ee.org/)):

- Most mailing list members are probably members of the club, by geographic coincidence.
- Announcements or discussion about club events are welcome on this mailing list, since they are generally open to the public.
- Being a TARA member is not a requirement to be a member of this mailing list.
